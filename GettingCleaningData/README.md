### Introduction

The goal of this program was to generate a tidy data set for further analysis.

Seven datasets, included in seven files, were used in this analysis:

- "subject_train.txt": IDs of subjects participating the experiments in the training group 

- "subject_test.txt": IDs of subjects participating the experiments in the test group 

- "y_train.txt": activity IDs for the training group

- "y_test.txt": activity IDs for the test group

- "activity_labels": six activities the subjects performed

- "X_train.txt": processed data for the training group, 561 data points each row

- "X_test.txt": processed data for the test group, 561 data points each row

- "features.txt": names of the 561 variables

Detailed information regarding how the processed data were obtained from the raw data
and the meaning of variables can be found in the markdown file "CodeBook.md".

The tidy data set was generated by the following five steps:

### 1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set

(1) Combines the training and test data sets into one data set

(2) Assigns column names to the above data set
   
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
for each measurement

(1) Extracts data columns with their names containing "mean()" from the dataset of 1(2)

(2) Extracts data columns with their names containing "std()" from the dataset of 1(2)

(3) combines the above two data sets into one data set

(4) Merges activity IDs from training and test sets and assigns its column name

(5) Combines subject IDs from training and test sets and assigns its column name

(6) Merges data sets from (5), (4) and (3) to generate the required data set  
 
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Replaces activity IDs with corresponding activity names in data set of 2(6)

### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

(1) Replaces abbreviation symbols with full names for variable names

(2) Corrects duplicate substrings ("BodyBody") in variable names

(3) Removes non-alphabet or non-numeric characters in variable names

### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

(1) Collapses the data set of 4(3) by activity and subjectID variables to generate 
a long form data set containing the average values of each variable. 

(2) Re-arrange columns to make the data set more readable

(3) write the data set of 5(1) to a text file. Each field was separated by a tab ("\t")
